/*

might be able to reduce into 0 and 1
ok probably not

think about states as [last used][all piles]

winning state is any state where there is one pile left that wasnt chosen last round

if piles = 1
current player wins

if piles = 2
current player wins because we can force the parity

if piles = 3

// Did you read the bounds?

// Are there edge cases (N=1?)
// Are array sizes proper (scaled by proper constant, for example 2* for koosaga tree)
// Integer overflow?
// DS reset properly between test cases?
// Is using long longs causing TLE?
// Are you using floating points?
